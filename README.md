# Cordapp Trials

Decentralized blockchain networks require participation from a wide group of participants from a diverse background. Cordapp Trial by R3 provide a 6 week educational walkthrough of applications which solve real world business use cases. A network of dozens of participants from around the world are brought together for a 1 week global trial which demonstrates the effectivess of blockchain solutions. Participants will get hands on with the technology to gain an understanding of what it means to run an application powered by blockchain.

Trial experiences have covered a variety of business use cases with many more to come.

- Know your customer (KYC)
- Reinsurance (Cordainsure)
- Real Estate (Instant Property)

## Trial Framework

For partners of R3 who wish to run their application in a Cordapp Trial will need to ensure it is ready to be deployed and used by a set of new customers. Generally there are a series of upgrades which must be made to provide a seamless experience to the participants of the trial.

This repository contains a set of documents, scripts, code snippets, confiuguration and sample data that will jump start your cordapp preparation. The end result will be a cordapp that will be cleanly deployable to Testnet and ready to meet the scale of a week long global trial.

## How should this framework be used?

In the framework's initial state the framework is intended to be used in tandem with guidance from your R3 solutions engineer. The content will improve over time to be a fully consumable without guidance.

The documents on application and deployment best practices are the best place to [begin](./docs)

## What is the Trial Framework?

This framework is a result of automation and stability improvements made as a part of executing previous Cordapp Trials. It provides a number of benefits that streamline the process of deploying and operating a Corda node.

- Scripts to setup Linux VMs
- Encapsulate the architecture in docker images 
- Business Network integration 

These are standard components leveraged across a variety of solutions which have already been pre-built and tested.
